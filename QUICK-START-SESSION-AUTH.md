## 🔐 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User logs in at /admin/login
   ↓
2. AdminJS creates session (cookie: 'adminjs')
   ↓
3. All /admin-api/* requests include session cookie
   ↓
4. Middleware checks req.session.adminUser
   ↓
5. If valid → allow access
   If not → 401 Unauthorized
```

### Session Data
```javascript
req.session.adminUser = {
  id: 1,
  email: "admin@university.edu.vn",
  role: "admin" // or "teacher"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests

- [x] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Login to AdminJS works
- [ ] Grade Entry page loads
- [ ] Student Import works
- [ ] Bulk Enrollment works
- [ ] Retake Management works
- [ ] Grade History works
- [ ] Role-based access working
- [ ] Logout works

### API Tests

```bash
# Test public route
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# ✅ Should return 200 OK

# Test protected route (without session)
curl http://localhost:3000/admin-api/grade/enrolled-students
# ✅ Should return 401 Unauthorized

# Test in browser (with session)
# Login first, then visit grade entry page
# ✅ Should load students successfully
```

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### API Routes Changed

All API routes moved from `/api/*` to `/admin-api/*`:

```diff
- /api/grade/enrolled-students
+ /admin-api/grade/enrolled-students

- /api/student-import/classes
+ /admin-api/student-import/classes

- /api/bulk-enrollment/enroll
+ /admin-api/bulk-enrollment/enroll
```

### Authentication Method Changed

```diff
- Authorization: Bearer <JWT-token>
+ Session cookie (automatic)
```

### Requires Re-login

Users will need to login again after deployment.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Login to AdminJS first at `/admin/login`

### Issue: Routes not working
**Solution:** Ensure using `/admin-api/*` prefix, not `/api/*`

### Issue: Session expires
**Solution:** Session timeout is 24 hours. Login again.

## 📞 Support

### Need Help?

1. Check **[SESSION-AUTH-MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md](./SESSION-AUTH-MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md)**
2. Review server logs
3. Test in browser console
4. Check session cookie exists

### Common Questions

**Q: Why change from JWT to Session?**  
A: JWT backend was not implemented. Session auth is built-in with AdminJS.

**Q: Is this secure?**  
A: Yes! AdminJS session uses HttpOnly cookies and server-side validation.

**Q: Can external systems still use the API?**  
A: Current routes are for AdminJS components only. For external access, create separate API routes.

**Q: What about mobile apps?**  
A: Session auth works with mobile browsers. For native apps, consider implementing JWT later.
